	            <h6><strong>Overview</strong></h6>
	            <p>The Harvard Art Museums is a newly reopened and completely redesigned institution that amass Harvard’s three main art museums, the Fogg, Arthur M. Sackler, and Busch-Riesinger, all under one roof.  Working with technologist Ian Callahan in the department of Digital Infrastructure and Emerging Technologies (DIET), last semester I focused on researching, designing, and developing a solution to redesign the event planning workflow for the museums. My goal going into the project was to get a better sense of the individual needs of each department and staff member who is involved in the process and uses the form regularly and then ultimately develop a solution that achieved the shortcoming of the current process and was completely digital.

	            <h6><strong>The Problem</strong></h6>
	            
	            <p>The existing event coordination flow is operated by completing and sending a PDF form via email to all relevant parties, and then resending the form to the same audience whenever a change is made.  This solution is clunky, inflexible, and time consuming and makes managing the roughly 25-30 events in progress at any given time a hassle.  As the museum grows its presence, the volume of events and communication needed for coordination will grow to make this process unless a change is made.My goal going into the project was to get a better sense of the individual needs of each department and staff member who is involved in the process and uses the form regularly.

	            <h6><strong>The Process</strong></h6>
	            
	            <p>I began meeting with Ian Callahan a few times to understand his perspective as the point person for the digital department when events are created.  Through him I found that most of the fields of the document were actually meeting their need, however some more loosely defined fields, like operations and security needs, were often overtyped, and led to email threads with additional text documents attached referencing those fields. After hearing about the major issues with the form, I researched existing event management solution offerings, both used by other areas of the university as well as outside solutions.  For most, their features were either too complex for the Museum’s needs or required licenses and contracts which were out of price range.  I then met several times with Sanja Cvjeticanin, Director of Visitor Services, who oversees event planning at the Museums.  Sanja was incredibly helpful in that she was eager to contribute to various design characteristics of the project, emphasizing her desire a “no error” interface that allows multiple contributors without the worry that any data is changed or removed by mistake.  I synthesized my interview findings and research on available frameworks and began work on building the prototype.

	            <h6><strong>Deliverables</strong></h6>
	            
	            <p>After the research phase, I worked to develop concepts, wireframes, and a front end prototype based on my interviews and successful existing solutions.  Since the layout and flow of the form was familiar and learned by the expected users, I chose to design a web form similar in organization, but with specific form elements to address specific needs.  For example, the operations and security needs fields grow dynamically to fit as much text as needed without affecting other sections of the form.  I worked using the Materialize CSS framwork, based on Google’s Material Design Language, for an intuitive front end experience that matches the minimalistic design of the Harvard Art Museums website and print material.  In total, I delivered research notes, sketches and wireframes, and developed front end prototypes for the main pages of the web application (event list, new/edit event, log in/out).

	            <p>This semester, I am returning to the project in a slightly different lens.  I am breaking down the project to address individual user stories I have compiled, as well as new ones attained through more interviews with museum staff.  I will then create a product requirements document using the Agile method for further design iteration and development.  I will also be working on web solutions for the Museum Approvals Process (MAP), with form issues similar to the events project.  MAP is the system for any department of the museum to propose bold initiatives and new projects or exhibitions to the Director’s office, and the rest of the organization.  Currently, it’s InfoPath workflow is limited to Windows machines only, so I am focused on finding and developing specific elements for database table manipulation that will let the new web app achieve the same degree of flexibility that InfoPath provides.  I will be conducting a series of “UI experiments” using Vue.js and Angular 2 to find a working solution to this problem.
